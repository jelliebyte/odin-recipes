# odin-recipes

Hello, this is a project made for TOP (The Odin Project)
This is a little website made to host recipes for various food dishes.
I will have to know how to:
- Set up an HTML file
- Format an HTML file
- Create ordered and unordered lists
-  Link between pages (Absolute and relative i think)
- Link images onto the webpage
